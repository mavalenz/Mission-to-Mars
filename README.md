# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
### We are assigned to help Robin gather data for the **Mission to Mars** from all over the web and display it in a central location. To do this we will help Robin by using the web scraping method to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, and present the collected data in a central location: a **webpage**. As part of the web scraping method we will perform the following:

- Identify where the data is stored within the HTML code for each webpage.
- Using DevTools, sift through the nested HTML code to find the exact tags we need to reference ino ur scraping script.
- Use Splinter to automate the web browser.
- Scrape data using BeautifulSoup.
- Automate the process by downloading our code into a python file.
- Save the data scraping results in Mongo.
- Use Flask to Create a Web App.
- Update the scraping code in a way that Flask can handle.
- Integrate Mongo into the web app.
- Create a portfolio.
- Adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images.
